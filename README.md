# Sentimentality Rater

This Python script gathers information from the provided JSON file of yelp reviews, and creates dictionary values for each word found in them, using the NLTK, based on the star rating of the review. It then averages each words score and sorts them into the highest scoring 500 and lowest scoring 500 words and outputs them to a file.
